%% Lesson 1. Visualize the dataset
% Your simulator have generated phase and amp matrices, using the patt (for pattern) images.
% You load the data into the workspace:
data = load('lesson1.mat');
whos

%% Task 1. Visualize random images on a plot in an array of NxN subplots.
% Hint: use subplot in a loop, pcolor or imshow for displaying


%% Task 2. Obtaian \Delta\phi and \phi_0 as difference on the edges and 
% central phase and use average efficiency as the color.


%% Task 3. Make a scatter plot of \phi_0 vs \Delta\phi. 


%% Task 4. Use MATLAB's least square approximation algorithm for getting \Delta\phi and \phi_0.


%% Task 5. Make the same scatter plot using function from Task 3. Compare results.


%% Task 6. (At home) Repeat the steps for the second order approximation.
% Hint 1: \Delta^2\phi is sum at the edges minus two central
% Hint 2: Use either different scatter plots, or a 3D one (scatter3) to
% visualize the 0, 1st and 2nd order coefficients.
